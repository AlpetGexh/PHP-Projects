(53, 'PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development.[5] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[6] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[7] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[6] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[8]\r\n\r\nPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control.[10] Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via command-line interface (CLI).', 'PHP', '.6023192747a2a6.80343340.png', 2, '2021-02-26 21:36:51'),
(56, 'JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.\r\n\r\nAlongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.\r\n\r\nAs a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).', 'JavaScript', '.602338bcd9ce12.46987055.jpg', 2, '2021-02-26 21:36:51'),
(57, 'Arduino (/ɑːrˈdwiːnoʊ/) is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Its hardware products are licensed under a CC-BY-SA license, while software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL),[1] permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors.\r\n\r\nArduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (\'shields\') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the \"Arduino language\".', 'Arduino', '.6023394a7b8c04.89131521.jpg', 2, '2021-02-26 21:36:51'),
(58, 'Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]', 'CSS', '.602339eb86f4a7.97949760.png', 2, '2021-02-26 21:36:51'),
(177, 'Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.\r\n\r\nWeb browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\r\n', 'HTML', '.60233a1a8ce0b3.15437451.png', 2, '2021-03-20 03:40:00'),
(178, 'Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[20]', 'Java', 'download.png', 2, '2021-03-20 03:41:45'),
(179, 'Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python\'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[29]\r\n\r\nPython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30]', 'Python', 'download.jpg', 2, '2021-03-20 03:42:56'),
(180, 'React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing.[7][8] React Router[9] is an example of such a library. And also large and complicated applications are required to make AJAX calls to fetch or mutate data. You can use any library you like with React such as Axios, JQuery AJAX or the browser built-in window.fetch. [10]', 'React', 'react.png', 2, '2021-03-20 03:43:51'),
(181, 'C++ (/ËŒsiËËŒplÊŒsËˆplÊŒs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or \"C with Classes\". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]', 'C++', 'png-clipart-c-logo-the-c-programming-language-computer-icons-computer-programming-source-code-programming-miscellaneous-template.png', 2, '2021-03-20 03:44:38'),
